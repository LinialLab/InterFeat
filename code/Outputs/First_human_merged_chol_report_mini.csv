feature_name,Interesting_hum,Int_ai,Plausible_hum,Plaus_ai,COMMENTS,Explanation (Interesting),Explanation (Plausible)
"Long-standing illness, disability or infirmity Yes",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,CVD risk factors,"Yes. This feature is interesting and novel because long-standing illnesses, disabilities, or infirmities can indicate a chronic state of health that may influence dietary habits, physical activity levels, and overall metabolic health. These factors can lead to changes in bile composition and gallbladder function, potentially increasing the risk of gallstones and related diseases. The significant p-value and SHAP importance suggest a meaningful association, indicating that this feature could be a relevant predictor for the target diseases.","Yes. Individuals with long-standing illnesses may have altered lifestyles, medication use, or metabolic profiles that could influence gallbladder function or bile composition, thereby increasing the risk of cholelithiasis and related diseases. Chronic illnesses can also affect dietary habits, which may contribute to gallstone formation."
Alanine aminotransferase,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,liver enzyme ,"Yes. Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels can indicate liver dysfunction or disease, which has been associated with the development of gallstones and related biliary diseases. The liver plays a crucial role in cholesterol metabolism, and disturbances in liver function can influence bile composition and increase the risk of gallstone formation. Thus, there is a plausible biological mechanism linking ALT levels to gallbladder disease.","Yes. Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are often indicative of liver dysfunction or injury, which can be associated with metabolic conditions that contribute to the formation of gallstones. For instance, conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can lead to dyslipidemia and increased cholesterol saturation in bile, promoting gallstone formation. Therefore, there is a plausible mechanism for ALT levels to be related to the risk of developing cholelithiasis and related diseases."
Mouth/teeth dental problems Dentures,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,nutrition,"No. This feature does not have a clear biological or clinical connection to cholelithiasis or related diseases. While dental problems may impact overall health, there is no established mechanism linking dental issues, such as wearing dentures, to the formation of gallstones or gallbladder disease. The correlation observed may simply be incidental or confounded by other factors, such as general health status or socioeconomic status, rather than a direct risk factor for the target diseases.","No. The connection between dental issues and gallbladder diseases is not well-established. While oral health can influence overall health, especially in terms of systemic inflammation, there is no direct or well-supported mechanism linking dental problems, specifically dentures, to the development of cholelithiasis or gallbladder disease. Additionally, the correlation and importance metrics provided do not imply a clinically significant relationship. Therefore, this feature does not make sense as a predictive factor for the target diseases mentioned."
Overall health rating Fair,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,,"Yes. A fair overall health rating indicates a potential presence of other underlying health issues, which could contribute to the risk of developing gallbladder diseases. Individuals rating their health as fair may have a higher prevalence of risk factors such as obesity, poor diet, or metabolic syndrome, all of which are known to be associated with cholelithiasis and related conditions.","Yes. A fair overall health rating may indicate underlying health issues, which could contribute to the risk of developing cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. Poor overall health can be associated with factors such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, or other chronic conditions that are known to influence gallstone formation. Moreover, individuals with compromised health may have lifestyle factors (e.g., diet, physical activity) that further increase their risk for these diseases."
Standard PRS for alzheimer's disease (AD),TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,"No. Alzheimer's disease and gallbladder diseases are not directly related, and the correlation and significance of this feature do not support a plausible mechanism linking them. The p-value and correlation indicate a lack of strong evidence for this feature as a risk factor for the target diseases.","No. There is no established mechanism linking Alzheimer's disease genetic risk factors directly to cholelithiasis or gallbladder diseases. These conditions are primarily related to metabolic factors, dietary habits, and gallbladder function rather than neurological conditions. Thus, while both may coexist in a patient, the direct predictive relationship seems implausible based on current medical understanding."
Overall health rating Excellent,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,healthy life style,No. A rating of 'Excellent' overall health suggests a low likelihood of developing comorbidities associated with gallbladder disease and may not provide novel insight into the risk factors for cholelithiasis or related conditions. This feature is more reflective of an individual's current health status rather than a predictive factor for the target diseases.,"Yes. An excellent overall health rating may indicate a healthier lifestyle, better dietary habits, and lower levels of obesity‚Äîall of which are protective factors against the development of gallbladder disease and cholelithiasis. Additionally, individuals who rate their health as excellent may be more likely to engage in preventive health behaviors that could reduce the risk of these conditions."
Haemoglobin concentration,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,M<>F,"No. The relationship between hemoglobin concentration and gallbladder diseases such as cholelithiasis is not well-established in the literature, and the p-value indicates a lack of strong association. Additionally, a correlation of -0.014 suggests a very weak negative relationship, which may not be clinically significant. Hemoglobin concentration is more commonly associated with anemia or other systemic conditions rather than being a direct predictor of gallbladder diseases. Therefore, it does not present as an interesting or novel feature in this context.","No. There is no clear or established mechanism that links haemoglobin concentration directly to the risk or development of cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. While haemoglobin levels can indicate various health conditions, they do not typically correlate with gallbladder disease mechanisms, which are more closely associated with factors like bile composition, fat intake, and metabolic syndrome. Therefore, while the p-value suggests statistical significance, the lack of biological plausibility makes this feature less meaningful in the context of predicting gallbladder disease."
SHBG,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,M<>F,No. Insufficient evidence linking SHBG to gallbladder disease.,"Yes. A plausible mechanism exists as SHBG (sex hormone-binding globulin) is involved in the regulation of sex hormones, which can influence metabolic processes and fat metabolism. Alterations in SHBG levels may affect cholesterol metabolism, potentially impacting gallstone formation, as cholesterol supersaturation is a key factor in gallstone disease. Additionally, hormonal factors can influence gallbladder motility and bile composition, which are relevant in the context of cholelithiasis and related diseases."
Standing height,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,M<>F,"No. Height alone is generally not a direct risk factor for gallbladder diseases like cholelithiasis or cholangitis. Although body composition and obesity (which can be correlated with height) are known risk factors, standing height itself does not provide sufficient insight into the mechanisms leading to these diseases. The correlation observed is weak and not clinically significant, suggesting that height may not have a direct influence on the development of gallbladder disease. Thus, while it might be interesting to explore, it is not novel or particularly useful in this context.","No. There is no established mechanism linking standing height to the development of cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. While anthropometric measurements can provide insights into overall health and can be associated with various diseases, standing height alone does not have a clear or direct relationship with gallstone disease. The correlation observed may be incidental or confounded by other factors such as body mass index (BMI) or diet."
Gastritis and duodenitis,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,life style,"No. While there may be some indirect associations between gastrointestinal disorders like gastritis and duodenitis and gallbladder diseases, the correlation is weak (0.013) and the clinical relevance is not well-established. Gastritis and duodenitis primarily affect the stomach and duodenum rather than the gallbladder directly. Therefore, this feature may not be a strong or novel predictor for the target diseases listed.","Yes. There is a plausible mechanism for gastritis and duodenitis to affect gallbladder diseases. Both conditions can lead to altered gastrointestinal function and may contribute to changes in bile composition or motility. For instance, chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract could affect the digestion and absorption of fats, potentially influencing the formation of gallstones. Additionally, inflammation can lead to increased cholesterol levels in bile, which is a known risk factor for the development of gallstones. Therefore, while the direct correlation may not be strong, there is a reasonable biological basis for considering gastritis and duodenitis as relevant factors in the context of gallbladder diseases."
Standard PRS for venous thromboembolic disease (VTE),FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,Obesity and lifesytle,"No. This feature does not have a clear or direct connection to gallbladder disease or cholelithiasis. While venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) may have some association with systemic health issues, its relevance as a predictor for gallbladder-related diseases is weak. The mechanisms underlying gallstone formation are primarily related to metabolic factors, bile composition, and dietary influences rather than thromboembolic risk factors. Thus, the feature lacks specificity and a plausible biological mechanism linking it to the target diseases.","No. The association between venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) and cholelithiasis or gallbladder diseases is not well-established. While VTE may be influenced by various factors, including obesity and inactivity, which can also impact gallstone formation, the direct link is tenuous. There isn't a clear biological mechanism that would support the idea that a genetic risk score for VTE would directly affect the risk for gallbladder disease or cholelithiasis. Therefore, this feature seems unlikely to be a relevant predictor or risk factor for the target diseases in question."
Townsend deprivation index at recruitment,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,important,"Yes. The Townsend deprivation index is a measure of socioeconomic status, which can influence health outcomes. Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may have limited access to healthcare, less healthy diets, and higher levels of stress, all of which can contribute to the development of gallbladder diseases, including cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. Understanding the relationship between socioeconomic status and these conditions could provide insights into disparities in health outcomes and inform public health interventions.","Yes. The Townsend deprivation index represents socioeconomic status, which can influence dietary habits, access to healthcare, and overall health behaviors. Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may have poorer diets, higher rates of obesity, and limited access to preventive care, all of which are recognized risk factors for gallbladder disease, including cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. Thus, there is a plausible mechanism for this feature to affect the target disease."
Illnesses of adopted father,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"No. The feature is likely not relevant for predicting cholelithiasis or related diseases. While family history can be important for many conditions, the specific illnesses of an adopted father may not have a direct or meaningful correlation to gallbladder disease. Additionally, the p-value indicates marginal significance, and the SHAP importance value suggests it contributes little to the model's predictive power. More relevant factors related to diet, lifestyle, and genetic predispositions would be more informative for these diseases.","No. This feature is unlikely to have a direct causal relationship with cholelithiasis or related diseases. While family history can play a role in the genetic predisposition to certain conditions, the specific illnesses of an adopted father may not be relevant unless they are directly linked to gallbladder health or metabolic processes. Additionally, since adoption introduces a different familial background, the relevance of the adopted father's illnesses is less clear."
Hot drink temperature Hot,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"No. There is no clear or established mechanism by which the temperature of hot drinks would directly influence the risk of developing cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. While excessive consumption of very hot beverages may be associated with other health risks, its relevance to gallbladder disease is not supported by significant scientific evidence. Therefore, this feature does not seem particularly interesting or novel in the context of the specified diseases.","No. There is no established connection between the temperature of hot drinks and the risk or development of cholelithiasis or related diseases. While extreme temperatures can cause mucosal injury in the gastrointestinal tract, it is unlikely that this specific feature directly influences the formation of gallstones or gallbladder disease. The lack of strong biological plausibility or clinical evidence to support a mechanism linking hot drink temperature to these conditions makes this feature less relevant as a predictive factor."
Alcohol drinker status Current,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,would expect a a higher correlation,"Yes. Alcohol consumption has been studied in relation to gallstone disease, with some evidence suggesting that moderate alcohol intake may be associated with a decreased risk of gallstones. The correlation and significance of this feature indicate it may have relevance in understanding the risk factors for the target diseases.","Yes. Alcohol consumption has been associated with various health outcomes, including effects on liver function and cholesterol metabolism, which can influence the formation of gallstones. Studies suggest that moderate alcohol consumption may have a protective effect against gallstone disease, potentially due to its influence on bile composition and motility. However, excessive alcohol intake can lead to liver disease, which may indirectly impact gallbladder health. Therefore, the feature is relevant, and there is a plausible mechanism for it to affect gallbladder-related diseases."
Contra-indications for spirometry,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"Probably, irrelevant - it is not avery useful feature in the clinic - it is probably related throught other features. (it usually means that the person has a significant disease burden (the C?I are: Absolute Contraindications
Hemodynamic instability.
Recent myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome.
Respiratory infection, a recent pneumothorax, or a pulmonary embolism.
A growing or large (>6 cm) aneurysm of the thoracic, abdominal aorta.
Hemoptysis of acute onset.
Intracranial hypertension.
Retinal detachment)","No. This feature is likely not directly relevant to cholelithiasis or related diseases. Contra-indications for spirometry generally pertain to respiratory conditions and do not have a clear or plausible mechanism linking them to gallstone disease or gallbladder issues. The correlation and p-value suggest that while there may be some statistical relationship, it does not imply causation or a meaningful clinical link to the target diseases.","No. This feature is not relevant to cholelithiasis or gallbladder disease. Contraindications for spirometry generally relate to respiratory conditions rather than gastrointestinal diseases. There is no plausible mechanism linking respiratory contraindications to the development or risk of gallbladder-related diseases. Thus, it does not make sense as a predictive feature for the specified target diseases."
Salt added to food Never/rarely,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,I'm not sure that this feature represent food prefencese it may be related to a prescribes. medical diet of kidney or heart failure,"No. The relationship between salt intake and gallbladder disease is not well established, and the feature does not provide significant insight into the risk factors associated with cholelithiasis or related diseases. Additionally, the p-value and correlation indicate that the association is weak, and the SHAP importance suggests that this feature may not have a substantial impact on the predictive model. Therefore, it lacks novelty and relevance in the context of gallbladder disease risk assessment.","No. There is no clear biological mechanism linking salt intake directly to the development of gallbladder diseases such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. While dietary factors can influence overall health and potentially impact gallbladder function, the specific impact of salt intake appears to be minimal. Additionally, the correlation and SHAP importance values suggest that this feature may not be a strong predictor for the target diseases in question."
Year immigrated to UK (United Kingdom),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"more inforamation is needed to under stand if these reflect a diffrent diet, or just age/ wave of immigration etc.","No. This feature does not show a clear or direct relationship with the target diseases, and the effect size is very small (correlation: -0.005, SHAP importance: 0.003). The year of immigration may reflect lifestyle or dietary changes, but without direct evidence linking it to gallbladder-related diseases, it is not considered a significant or novel predictor. It is more indicative of demographic factors rather than a biological or physiological mechanism that could influence the development of cholelithiasis or related conditions.","No. The year of immigration to the UK does not have a direct biological or clinical relevance to the development of cholelithiasis or gallbladder diseases. While it might be related to cultural or dietary changes, the correlation is weak, and there is insufficient evidence to suggest a plausible mechanism through which this feature would meaningfully impact the risk of these diseases. Additionally, factors such as lifestyle, diet, and healthcare access may be more relevant to the analysis rather than the timing of immigration alone."
Job code at visit,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,This is a not an ordinal data (i assume) ,No. Job code may not directly link to the pathophysiology of gallbladder disease but may indicate socioeconomic factors that correlate with health outcomes. Its relevance is likely indirect and requires further contextual understanding to assess its significance as a risk factor for the target diseases.,"No. Job code might indicate socioeconomic status or lifestyle factors, but it does not have a direct physiological mechanism that links it to the development of cholelithiasis or related diseases. The correlation may merely reflect underlying factors associated with job type rather than a direct risk factor for the target disease."
Neuroticism score,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"The p-value is very high, so I'm nor sure if it is truly relevant","No. The p-value indicates a lack of statistical significance, and the correlation is very low, suggesting that neuroticism is unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the development of cholelithiasis or related diseases. Additionally, there is no clear biological mechanism linking neuroticism to gallbladder disease.","No. The high p-value (0.902) indicates that there is no significant association between neuroticism score and the target diseases (Cholelithiasis, Gallstones, Gallbladder disease, Cholecystitis, or Cholangitis). Additionally, the correlation is very weak (-0.007), suggesting that neuroticism does not have a meaningful impact on these conditions. There is no plausible mechanism to connect neuroticism with gallbladder-related diseases, making this feature irrelevant in this context."
"dietary changes in the last 5 years Yes, because of other reasons",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,change of diet can be post cholelthiasis diagnosis,"No. This feature may reflect changes in eating habits due to existing health problems rather than being a direct risk factor for gallbladder diseases. The correlation and importance are low, suggesting limited predictive value. It is more likely that dietary changes occur after the onset of conditions like cholelithiasis rather than being a predictor.","Yes. Dietary changes can influence the composition of bile and the formation of gallstones. Factors such as increased intake of fiber, reduced fat consumption, or changes in the types of fats consumed can affect cholesterol levels in the bile, potentially impacting the risk of cholelithiasis and associated diseases. Additionally, dietary changes may reflect underlying health conditions that could predispose individuals to gallbladder disease or cholangitis."
Variation in diet Never/rarely,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"Normal BMI, asymptomatic person","No. The feature ""Variation in diet Never/rarely"" is not particularly interesting or novel as a predictive factor for cholelithiasis or related diseases. A lack of dietary variation may suggest a restricted diet that could lead to other health issues, but it does not have a direct and well-established connection to gallstone disease. The correlation is minimal, and its impact appears to be negligible, making it unlikely to be a significant risk factor for the target diseases.","No. A lack of variation in diet may lead to nutritional deficiencies or an imbalance in nutrient intake, but it does not directly correlate with the pathophysiology of gallbladder diseases such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. Moreover, the correlation value is very low, suggesting that it is unlikely to be a meaningful predictor or risk factor for these conditions. Thus, while diet can influence gallstone formation through factors such as obesity and dietary fat, the specific feature of ""variation in diet"" does not appear to have a strong or direct connection to the target diseases in question."
Z51.5 - Palliative care,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,"No. It indicates advanced disease or complications, which may not directly relate to the risk of developing cholelithiasis or gallbladder diseases but rather reflects a patient's existing health status and severity of illness.","No. Palliative care typically indicates a focus on comfort and management of symptoms in patients with serious illness, suggesting advanced disease rather than a direct risk or protective factor for gallbladder-related diseases. Therefore, it does not make sense as a predictive feature for cholelithiasis or related conditions."
Alcohol intake frequency. Three or four times a week,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,"Yes. Multiple studies suggest a relationship between moderate alcohol consumption and a reduced risk of gallbladder disease. Alcohol may influence bile composition and gallbladder motility, potentially affecting gallstone formation. This feature is interesting and could provide insights into dietary influences on gallstone disease.","Yes. Alcohol consumption has been associated with changes in bile composition and gallbladder function, which can influence the risk of developing gallstones and related diseases. Moderate alcohol intake may alter lipid metabolism and bile acid composition, potentially reducing the risk of gallstone formation. The association between alcohol intake frequency and gallbladder disease suggests that it could be a relevant factor in the pathophysiology of these conditions."
Wheeze or whistling in the chest in last year,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,person more sick in general? more imagery studies leading to higher incidental diagnoses rate?,"No. This feature does not appear to have a clear or direct connection to the pathophysiology of cholelithiasis or gallbladder disease. Wheezing or whistling in the chest is typically associated with respiratory issues, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), rather than biliary tract diseases. The correlation and SHAP importance values suggest that while there is statistical significance, the clinical relevance and biological plausibility of this feature impacting gallbladder disease are weak.","No. Wheezing or whistling in the chest is primarily associated with respiratory conditions rather than gastrointestinal diseases like cholelithiasis or gallbladder disease. There is no clear or plausible mechanism linking respiratory symptoms directly to the development of gallstones or related conditions. Therefore, this feature may not be relevant as a predictor or risk factor for the specified target diseases."
Time spent outdoors in winter,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"No. The p-value of 0.117 suggests that there is not enough statistical significance to support this feature as a predictor for the target diseases. Additionally, the correlation and SHAP importance values are very low, indicating that the feature does not have a strong association with cholelithiasis or related conditions. There is no clear biological mechanism that would link time spent outdoors in winter to the development of gallstones or gallbladder disease, making this feature unlikely to be relevant in a clinical or research context.","No. The feature does not provide clear relevance to the target diseases. Time spent outdoors in winter is unlikely to have a direct biological mechanism affecting the risk of cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. Factors such as diet, obesity, genetics, and other lifestyle choices have more established associations with these conditions. Therefore, this feature lacks a plausible mechanism to impact gallbladder health significantly."
Alcohol intake frequency. Daily or almost daily,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"inline with  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27926662/      . A linear dose-response relationship was found between alcohol consumption and gallstone disease risk and the risk of gallstone disease decreased by 12% (RR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.92; Pnonlinearity=0.079) for each 10 g/day increment in alcohol consumption. This meta-analysis suggests that alcohol consumption is associated with significantly decreased risk of gallstone disease.","Yes. Alcohol consumption is associated with a decreased risk of gallstone disease, as supported by studies showing a linear dose-response relationship where increased alcohol intake correlates with a lower incidence of gallstones. This feature could represent a protective factor for the target diseases, making it relevant and interesting for further exploration in relation to cholelithiasis and related conditions.","Yes. Research suggests a dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption and gallstone disease risk, indicating that moderate alcohol intake may be associated with a decreased risk of developing gallstones. This may be due to alcohol's effects on lipid metabolism and bile composition, which can influence gallstone formation. Therefore, the feature makes sense as a potential protective factor for the diseases listed."
Alcohol intake frequency. Special occasions only,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"inline with  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27926662/      . A linear dose-response relationship was found between alcohol consumption and gallstone disease risk and the risk of gallstone disease decreased by 12% (RR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.92; Pnonlinearity=0.079) for each 10 g/day increment in alcohol consumption. This meta-analysis suggests that alcohol consumption is associated with significantly decreased risk of gallstone disease.","Yes. Alcohol consumption patterns can influence bile composition and gallstone formation. Occasional alcohol intake may be associated with lower risk compared to regular consumption, suggesting a potential protective role.","Yes. Alcohol consumption patterns can influence gallbladder health. Lower frequency of alcohol intake, such as on special occasions only, may be associated with a healthier lifestyle and dietary habits, potentially reducing the risk of developing gallstones or gallbladder disease. Furthermore, excessive alcohol intake is known to have deleterious effects on liver function, which can indirectly affect bile production and gallbladder function. Thus, this feature appears relevant in the context of gallbladder disease risk."
Average Diameter for HDL Particles,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,No. HDL size is not directly related to gallstone disease; it is more relevant to cardiovascular health.,"Yes. Higher HDL is generally associated with better lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health, which could influence gallstone formation. HDL cholesterol may play a role in cholesterol transport and metabolism, potentially affecting gallbladder function. Additionally, variations in HDL particle size and composition can impact cholesterol solubility and gallstone formation risk, making this feature relevant in understanding the disease mechanisms involved in cholelithiasis and related conditions."
Apolipoprotein A Blood biochemistry,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,"No. While apolipoproteins are involved in lipid metabolism, the specific association with gallbladder diseases like cholelithiasis or cholangitis is not well established. Additionally, the very low correlation and SHAP importance suggest limited relevance as a predictive feature. Therefore, it may not provide actionable insights in the context of these diseases.","No. The correlation is weak, and the SHAP importance is low, indicating that Apolipoprotein A likely does not have a significant or direct impact on the development of cholelithiasis or related diseases. While apolipoproteins are involved in lipid metabolism, the specific relationship with gallbladder disease is not well established, making this feature less relevant as a predictor in this context."
Genetic risk for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Mid P value,"No. The correlation and p-value indicate that there is no significant relationship between genetic risk for epithelial ovarian cancer and the target diseases. Additionally, ovarian cancer and gallbladder diseases are not directly related, making this feature less relevant as a predictive factor for cholelithiasis or gallbladder disease.","No. The p-value of 0.12 suggests that this feature is not statistically significant, indicating that there is no strong evidence to support a relationship between genetic risk for epithelial ovarian cancer and the target diseases related to gallbladder and biliary conditions. Additionally, there is no clear biological mechanism that would link genetic predisposition to ovarian cancer with the development of cholelithiasis or related conditions, as they are distinct pathologies involving different organ systems and etiologies."
Time spend outdoors in summer,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,May reflect more physical activity,"No. The correlation and SHAP importance are low, indicating minimal impact on the target disease. Additionally, while spending time outdoors may relate to overall health and lifestyle factors, there is no established direct mechanism linking this feature to the risk of cholelithiasis or gallbladder disease.","No. While spending time outdoors may be associated with overall health and physical activity, there is no direct, established mechanism linking time spent outdoors specifically to the development of cholelithiasis or related diseases. Factors such as diet, metabolism, and genetic predisposition are more relevant to the formation of gallstones and gallbladder diseases. Therefore, this feature may not be a significant predictive factor for the target diseases in question."
Z92.2 - Personal history of long-term (current) use of other medicaments,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Sicker people - more sick?/more imagery studies?,"No. The high p-value (0.816) indicates that there is no significant association between the feature and the target disease. Additionally, the very low correlation and SHAP importance suggest that this feature is unlikely to provide meaningful information regarding the risk or prediction of cholelithiasis or related diseases. Therefore, it does not appear to be interesting or novel in this context.","No. The high p-value (0.816) and low correlation (0.001) suggest that this feature does not have a significant relationship with the target diseases. Additionally, the SHAP importance score of 0.003 indicates that this feature contributes very little to the model's predictions. There is no clear or plausible mechanism by which a personal history of long-term use of other medicaments would directly influence the development of cholelithiasis, gallstones, gallbladder disease, cholecystitis, or cholangitis. This feature might not provide meaningful insights into the risk or protective factors for these conditions."
Genetic risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"No. There is no established link between genetic risk factors for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and the development of cholelithiasis or gallbladder diseases. While both conditions may be influenced by genetic factors, their pathophysiology and risk factors differ significantly, making this feature unlikely to be relevant as a predictive or risk factor for gallbladder-related diseases.","No. There is no clear biological or clinical mechanism linking genetic risk factors for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to the development of cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. AMD primarily affects the eyes and is related to retinal health, while gallbladder diseases are more closely associated with factors such as obesity, diet, and bile composition. Therefore, this feature does not make sense as a predictive factor for gallbladder-related diseases."
Irritability,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,true for all similar cases - not surehow to relate to such low correlation,"No. Irritability is a nonspecific symptom that does not directly relate to gallbladder diseases and lacks a clear mechanistic link to cholelithiasis or related conditions. Its correlation and importance scores suggest it does not provide significant predictive value in this context, making it less relevant as a risk or protective factor for these diseases.","No. Irritability does not have a direct or plausible mechanism to affect the development of cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. While psychological factors can influence overall health, there is no established linkage between irritability and the physiological processes associated with gallstone formation or gallbladder disease. Therefore, it is unlikely to be an important predictive feature for this target disease."
Apolipoprotein A1,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002368372202339X,"Yes. Apolipoprotein A1 is important in lipid metabolism and is associated with HDL cholesterol levels, which have been linked to gallbladder disease. A higher level of Apolipoprotein A1 may be protective against the formation of gallstones, thus making this feature relevant and interesting in the context of cholelithiasis and related diseases.","Yes. Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) is a major component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and plays a critical role in lipid metabolism. Higher levels of ApoA1 are associated with increased HDL cholesterol, which has been suggested to have a protective effect against gallstone formation due to its role in cholesterol transport and metabolism. Additionally, HDL has anti-inflammatory properties, which may reduce the risk of gallbladder disease by mitigating inflammatory processes in the biliary tract. Therefore, the presence and levels of ApoA1 could plausibly influence the risk of cholelithiasis and related diseases."
Total bilirubin,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,"No. The correlation and SHAP importance values are low, suggesting that total bilirubin may not be a significant predictor for cholelithiasis or related diseases. Additionally, while bilirubin levels can indicate liver or bile duct issues, they are not directly linked to the formation of gallstones or gallbladder disease in a consistent manner. Thus, this feature does not provide enough evidence to be considered interesting or novel in this context.","Yes. Total bilirubin levels can reflect liver function and biliary obstruction. Elevated bilirubin may indicate cholestasis, which can be associated with gallbladder disease or cholangitis. Furthermore, conditions leading to increased bilirubin may also influence the formation of gallstones, making it relevant in the context of cholelithiasis and related diseases. Overall, it is plausible that total bilirubin could serve as an indicator of underlying issues that contribute to gallbladder-related diseases."
Alcohol intake frequency. One to three times a month,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,,"Yes. Moderate alcohol consumption has been shown to have a protective effect against the development of gallstone disease. Research suggests that light to moderate alcohol intake may positively influence bile composition and gallbladder motility, potentially reducing the risk of cholelithiasis and related diseases. The frequency of alcohol intake as described in this feature could be relevant in assessing an individual's risk profile for gallbladder-related conditions.","Yes. Alcohol intake has been shown to have a complex relationship with gallbladder and liver health. Moderate alcohol consumption may have protective effects against gallstone formation, as it can influence lipid metabolism and reduce cholesterol saturation in bile. However, the mechanism is not fully understood and can vary based on individual factors, such as genetics and overall health. Therefore, the frequency of alcohol intake as a feature may provide insights into gallbladder disease risk."
Diverticulosis,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Mid P value,"No. There is no established connection between diverticulosis and gallbladder diseases such as cholelithiasis or cholangitis. The p-value indicates that the association is not statistically significant, and the correlation is negligible. Thus, it lacks relevance as a predictive feature for the target diseases mentioned.","No. The lack of significance (high p-value) and very low correlation suggest that diverticulosis is unlikely to be a relevant risk or protective factor for cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. There is no well-established mechanism linking diverticulosis directly to the development of gallstones or gallbladder disease, as these conditions generally involve different pathophysiological processes."
Frequency of friend/family visits Almost daily,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"more active, less sick","No. The correlation is very low and it is unlikely that the frequency of social interactions has a direct or significant impact on the risk of developing cholelithiasis or associated diseases. While social support can influence overall health, it does not have a clear mechanism to directly affect gallbladder disease. Therefore, this feature is not particularly interesting or novel in the context of predicting the specified target diseases.","No. The frequency of friend/family visits likely reflects social support and emotional well-being rather than a direct biological mechanism influencing the development of cholelithiasis or related diseases. While social factors can have an indirect impact on health behaviors (such as diet and exercise), the correlation here is weak, and there isn't a clear, plausible mechanism linking social visits to the pathophysiology of gallbladder disease. Therefore, it is not a strong or relevant predictive feature for the target diseases."
Genetic risk for venous thromboembolic disease (VTE),TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"No. - There is no strong evidence to suggest that genetic risk for venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) has a direct correlation or impact on the development of cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. The p-value of 0.054 indicates that the association is not statistically significant at conventional thresholds (typically p < 0.05), suggesting that this feature may not be a reliable predictor or risk factor for the target diseases in question.","No. The association between genetic risk for venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) and gallbladder diseases is not well established. While there may be shared risk factors like obesity or sedentary lifestyle, the mechanisms linking VTE directly to gallbladder diseases such as cholelithiasis or cholangitis are unclear and not supported by strong evidence. Therefore, this feature does not provide a clear or plausible mechanism to affect the target diseases."
Genetic risk for parkinson's disease (PD),TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,High P value,"No. The lack of significant correlation and a high p-value suggest that genetic risk for Parkinson's disease is unlikely to have a meaningful impact on cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. There is no established biological mechanism connecting Parkinson's disease genetics with gallbladder disease, making this feature not particularly interesting or novel in this context.","No. There is no established relationship or plausible mechanism linking genetic risk for Parkinson's disease to the development of cholelithiasis or gallbladder disease. The p-value indicates a lack of statistical significance, and the correlation is very low, suggesting that this feature is unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the target diseases in question."
Other disorders of stomach and duodenum,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"No. This feature is likely too broad and nonspecific to be a reliable predictive factor for cholelithiasis or related diseases. While disorders of the stomach and duodenum may impact gastrointestinal health, their direct relationship with gallbladder disease is unclear. More specific factors related to gallbladder function or bile composition would provide better insight into the risk of these conditions.","No. The correlation and SHAP importance are very low, indicating minimal impact on the target disease. Additionally, while stomach and duodenal disorders may affect digestion, the direct relationship with gallbladder diseases like cholelithiasis is not well-established, making the feature unlikely to be a significant predictor or risk factor."
Genetic risk for osteoporosis (OP),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,"No. The feature shows a high p-value (0.522), indicating no significant association with the target diseases. The correlation is also weak (-0.007), and the SHAP importance is low (0.002), suggesting that it does not contribute meaningfully to predicting the target disease. There is no plausible mechanism linking genetic risk for osteoporosis directly to gallbladder diseases or cholelithiasis, making this feature unlikely to be useful in this context.","No. There is no clear biological mechanism linking genetic risk for osteoporosis to gallbladder diseases. Osteoporosis primarily affects bone density and strength, while cholelithiasis and related conditions are more closely associated with factors like bile composition, obesity, and diet. Thus, the presence of a genetic risk for osteoporosis does not provide relevant information for predicting the risk of gallbladder diseases."
Chronic airway obstruction,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,"No. While chronic airway obstruction can indicate a patient's overall health status, it does not have a direct or plausible mechanism to link it to gallbladder diseases such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. These conditions are primarily related to factors such as diet, obesity, and metabolic issues rather than respiratory conditions. Therefore, the feature may not be interesting or novel in this context.","No. There is no direct link between chronic airway obstruction and gallbladder disease. Chronic airway obstruction primarily affects the respiratory system, while gallbladder diseases are more related to metabolic factors, diet, and bile composition. While both conditions might coexist in patients, they do not share a causal relationship or mechanism that would support chronic airway obstruction as a relevant predictor for gallbladder-related diseases."
Genetic risk for atrial fibrillation (AF),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Mid  P value,"No. The p-value of 0.136 indicates that this feature is not statistically significant and therefore is unlikely to be a reliable predictor or risk factor for the target diseases. The correlation of -0.003 suggests a very weak relationship, and the low SHAP importance (0.002) indicates that this feature does not contribute meaningfully to the model's predictions. As a result, there is no strong evidence to suggest a plausible mechanism linking genetic risk for atrial fibrillation to cholelithiasis or related conditions.","No. There is no established link between genetic risk for atrial fibrillation (AF) and the development of cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. While both conditions may be influenced by broader health factors, the specific genetic predisposition for AF does not provide a clear mechanism or relationship to gallbladder disease. The correlation and p-value suggest that this feature is not significantly predictive or relevant in this context."
Skin colour Brown,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,"No. There is no clear biological mechanism or established literature linking skin color to the risk of gallbladder-related diseases. The p-value indicates some statistical significance, but the correlation and SHAP importance values are very low, suggesting that this feature does not contribute meaningfully to predicting the target disease. Thus, it does not warrant further clinical consideration as a relevant predictive factor.","No. Skin color does not have a direct biological mechanism influencing the development of cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. While social determinants of health and lifestyle factors associated with different ethnicities may indirectly influence risk, the feature itself lacks a clear and direct relationship to the pathophysiology of gallstone formation or related conditions. Therefore, it is unlikely to serve as a meaningful predictive factor for these diseases."
Tea intake,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,Mid P value,"No. The p-value of 0.274 indicates that there is no statistically significant association between tea intake and the target diseases, and the correlation of -0.004 suggests an extremely weak relationship. Additionally, the SHAP importance of 0.001 further implies that tea intake does not have a meaningful impact on predicting the target diseases. Thus, it is not considered interesting or novel.","No. The p-value indicates a lack of statistical significance, and the correlation is very weak, suggesting that tea intake is unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the risk of cholelithiasis or related diseases. There is insufficient evidence to support a plausible mechanism linking tea intake to these conditions."
Job code at visit nurses,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,This is a not an ordinal data (i assume) ,"No. Job code does not directly relate to the pathophysiology or risk factors of cholelithiasis or associated diseases. It is unlikely to provide meaningful insight into the development or progression of gallbladder disease, as it is more of a demographic or occupational variable rather than a health-related or clinical factor.","No. The feature ""Job code at visit nurses"" does not provide a direct biological or clinical mechanism that would plausibly link it to the development of cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. While healthcare workers may have unique health risks or exposures, the correlation observed here (p-value 0.082) is not strong enough to suggest a meaningful predictive relationship. Without more specific context regarding how job responsibilities might impact health in relation to gallbladder disease, this feature lacks relevance as a risk or protective factor."
Job code at visit managers,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,This is a not an ordinal data (i assume)  - probably irrlavent but we should check,"No. Job code alone does not provide direct biological or lifestyle insights that would plausibly influence the risk of cholelithiasis or related diseases. It lacks a clear mechanism or established connection to the disease, making it less relevant as a predictive feature.","No. Job code alone does not provide a direct mechanism or relevant information to predict or explain the risk of cholelithiasis or related diseases. While occupation can influence health through stress, lifestyle, and access to healthcare, the specific job code of ""managers"" lacks a clear connection to the pathophysiology or risk factors associated with gallbladder diseases. Further contextual information about lifestyle factors or health behaviors associated with this job type would be necessary to establish any plausible link."
Leg fat-free mass,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,,"Yes. Increased fat-free mass in the legs may indicate a healthier body composition and could influence metabolic factors related to gallstone formation. Higher levels of physical activity are often associated with greater fat-free mass, which may lead to improved metabolic health and reduced risk of gallbladder disease. The correlation, although small, suggests a potential relationship worth further investigation.","Yes. Leg fat-free mass is a component of overall body composition and could be associated with metabolic health. Increased fat-free mass may indicate better physical fitness and lower levels of obesity, which are known risk factors for gallstone disease. Additionally, healthy body composition can influence cholesterol metabolism and bile composition, potentially reducing the risk of gallstone formation."
Sleep - Overall average,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,"No. Sleep quality typically affects overall health and well-being, but there is no strong evidence linking sleep patterns directly to gallbladder diseases such as cholelithiasis or cholangitis. While poor sleep may contribute to metabolic issues, which can be associated with gallbladder disease, the direct mechanism remains unclear. The correlation is weak and may not represent a significant predictive factor for the specified diseases.","Yes. Sleep quality and duration can influence metabolic health, including factors like obesity and insulin resistance, which are known risk factors for gallstone formation. Poor sleep may lead to dietary choices and lifestyle behaviors that increase the risk of developing cholelithiasis and related conditions. Adequate sleep is also associated with better overall health and may contribute to maintaining a healthy weight, which is protective against gallbladder disease."
Genetic risk for coeliac disease (CED),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,High P value,"No. The p-value is relatively high, and the correlation is weak, indicating that genetic risk for coeliac disease is unlikely to be a significant predictor or risk factor for gallbladder-related diseases. Additionally, there is no established mechanism linking coeliac disease to cholelithiasis or related conditions, making this feature not particularly interesting or novel in this context.","No. The p-value suggests that this feature does not have a statistically significant association with the target diseases. Furthermore, while celiac disease is related to dietary factors and malabsorption, there is no strong biological mechanism or evidence to suggest that genetic risk for celiac disease directly influences the development of cholelithiasis or related gallbladder conditions. The correlation is also weak, indicating that it is unlikely to be a relevant predictor or risk factor in this context."
Genetic risk for coronary artery disease (CAD),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,High P value,"No. The high p-value (0.954) indicates that there is no statistically significant association between genetic risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) and the target diseases being considered (Cholelithiasis, Gallstones, Gallbladder disease, or Cholangitis). Additionally, the correlation is very low (-0.005), suggesting that there is essentially no relationship between these variables. Therefore, this feature is neither interesting nor novel in the context of predicting the target diseases.","No. The p-value indicates a lack of statistical significance, and the correlation is very weak, suggesting that genetic risk for coronary artery disease does not have a meaningful relationship with cholelithiasis or related diseases. There is no clear biological mechanism linking CAD genetic risk factors to gallbladder disease, making this feature unlikely to be a relevant predictor or risk factor for the target diseases."
Skin colour Black,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,"No. Skin color is not a direct risk factor for gallbladder diseases. While there may be disparities in health outcomes across different populations, using skin color as a predictive feature lacks a clear biological mechanism linking it directly to cholelithiasis or related conditions. Therefore, it does not provide meaningful information for predicting these diseases.","No. Skin color alone does not have a direct causal relationship with the risk of cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. While certain populations may have varying prevalence rates of gallstones due to genetic, dietary, or environmental factors, skin color itself is not a biological risk factor. Therefore, the feature lacks a plausible mechanistic basis for affecting the target disease directly."
Testosterone,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,Women have more ,"No. Testosterone levels are not typically associated with gallbladder disease or cholelithiasis directly. While hormonal factors can influence various metabolic processes, the relationship between testosterone and gallbladder diseases is not well-established in the literature. Moreover, the correlation and SHAP importance values suggest that this feature may not have a significant impact on the risk for these conditions. Therefore, it lacks novelty and relevance as a predictive feature for the target diseases mentioned.","Yes. Testosterone may influence gallstone formation due to its effects on lipid metabolism and bile composition. There is evidence suggesting that hormone levels can affect the synthesis and secretion of bile acids, which play a role in gallstone pathogenesis. Lower testosterone levels may be associated with alterations in cholesterol metabolism, which is a key factor in gallstone formation. Additionally, testosterone's effect on body weight and fat distribution could indirectly influence gallbladder disease risk."
Genetic risk for bipolar disorder,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,less imagery?,"No. There is no clear biological or clinical mechanism linking genetic risk for bipolar disorder to the development of cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. While certain psychiatric conditions can have systemic effects on health, the correlation here is weak, and further research would be required to establish any significant connection. The p-value indicates a level of significance, but the overall low correlation and SHAP importance suggest minimal practical relevance to the target diseases.","No. The relationship between genetic risk for bipolar disorder and cholelithiasis or gallbladder disease is not well established in the literature. There is no clear biological mechanism linking these two conditions, as they are primarily associated with different physiological processes. Furthermore, the p-value indicates a weak association, and the correlation is negligible. Therefore, this feature does not make sense as a predictive or risk factor for the specified target diseases."
Genetic risk for intraocular pressure,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,High P value same feature like 61,"No. The p-value of 0.791 indicates that there is no significant association between genetic risk for intraocular pressure and the target diseases of cholelithiasis, gallstones, gallbladder disease, or cholangitis. Additionally, the correlation of 0.007 suggests a very weak relationship, and with a SHAP importance of 0.004, this feature is unlikely to be meaningful or provide relevant predictive value for the target diseases. As such, it does not make sense in this context.","No. There is no established connection between genetic risk factors for intraocular pressure and gallbladder diseases such as cholelithiasis or cholangitis. Intraocular pressure is primarily related to eye health and conditions like glaucoma, whereas gallbladder diseases are influenced by factors such as diet, obesity, and metabolic conditions. The lack of correlation and high p-value further suggest that this feature is not relevant in the context of the target diseases."
Home area population density - urban or rural England/Wales - Village - less sparse,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,Is this an ordinal parameter,"No. The correlation is weak and does not suggest a clear mechanism linking population density to gallbladder diseases. The relationship may be confounded by other factors such as diet, lifestyle, and access to healthcare, making it less relevant as a predictive feature in this context.","No. It is unlikely that population density directly impacts the risk of gallbladder diseases such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. While living in urban or rural areas may correlate with lifestyle factors (such as diet and access to healthcare), the feature itself does not provide a direct mechanism or established link to these specific diseases. Any perceived association may be confounded by other factors related to urbanization or rural living, such as socioeconomic status or health behaviors."
Genetic risk for intraocular pressure (IOP),TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,High P value same feature like 59,"No. The correlation and p-value indicate that this feature is not statistically significant or predictive for the target diseases listed. There is no plausible mechanism connecting genetic risk for intraocular pressure (IOP) to cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases, as these conditions primarily involve metabolic and biliary factors rather than ocular genetics.","No. The genetic risk for intraocular pressure (IOP) does not have a clear or plausible mechanism to influence the development of cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. These conditions are primarily related to factors such as diet, obesity, and biliary metabolism rather than ocular health or intraocular pressure. The lack of significant correlation (p-value: 0.791) further suggests that this feature is unlikely to be relevant in this context."
Genetic risk for prostate cancer (PC),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Mid P value + low correlation,"No. The p-value indicates that there is no statistically significant association between genetic risk for prostate cancer and the target diseases of cholelithiasis, gallstones, gallbladder disease, or cholangitis. Additionally, the correlation is very low, suggesting that there is no meaningful relationship between these factors. Therefore, this feature is not interesting or novel as a predictive factor for the target disease.",No. There is no established direct link between genetic risk factors for prostate cancer and the development of cholelithiasis or gallbladder diseases. Prostate cancer and gallbladder diseases are generally considered separate entities with different risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms. The lack of a significant correlation (with a p-value of 0.258) further supports the notion that this feature is unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the target diseases in question.
Genetic risk for age at menopause (AAM),TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,Mid  P value / AAM related to estrogen level,"No. The association between age at menopause and gallbladder disease is not well-established in the literature, and although hormonal changes during menopause can affect cholesterol levels and gallstone formation, the genetic risk for age at menopause does not appear to directly correlate with the risk factors for cholelithiasis or related diseases. Therefore, this feature does not provide a strong basis for being an interesting or novel predictive factor for the target diseases mentioned.","Yes. Menopause can influence biliary lipid metabolism and gallbladder motility, potentially affecting gallstone formation. Hormonal changes during menopause may alter cholesterol levels and bile production, which could contribute to the development of gallstones and related conditions. Therefore, genetic risk factors for age at menopause could indirectly impact the risk of cholelithiasis and associated diseases."
Genetic risk for bowel cancer (CRC),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,High P value,"No. The lack of significant association (p-value of 0.259) suggests that genetic risk for bowel cancer does not have a relevant or direct impact on the development of cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. Additionally, the correlation value is low, indicating a weak relationship, and the SHAP importance is minimal, suggesting it does not substantially contribute to predictive modeling for these conditions. Therefore, this feature does not provide novel or meaningful insight into the target diseases.","No. There is no clear biological mechanism linking genetic risk for bowel cancer to cholelithiasis or gallbladder diseases. While both conditions involve the gastrointestinal system, they are distinct diseases with different etiologies and risk factors. The correlation observed is weak and not statistically significant, which suggests that this feature is unlikely to be a relevant predictive factor for the target diseases mentioned."
Enhanced Genetic risk for height,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,High P value + what is risk for height? whydidn't I get such a nice risk ;-)? may be related to ethnicity,No. The feature does not provide relevant information regarding the risk or protective factors for cholelithiasis or related diseases. Height is generally considered a non-modifiable trait and does not have a direct or plausible mechanism linking it to gallbladder diseases. The lack of significance in p-value (0.931) and the low correlation further support that this feature is unlikely to be meaningful or novel in relation to the target diseases.,"No. There is no plausible mechanism connecting genetic risk for height to cholelithiasis or related diseases. Height is unlikely to influence the development of gallbladder disease, as these conditions are primarily affected by metabolic factors, diet, and other health conditions rather than genetic factors related to stature. The correlation and SHAP importance values also suggest that this feature has minimal relevance to the target disease."
Basophill percentage,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,high P value,"No. The p-value of 0.568 indicates a lack of statistical significance, suggesting that the basophil percentage is unlikely to have a meaningful association with the target diseases. Additionally, the correlation of -0.006 and low SHAP importance (0.003) further support the conclusion that this feature does not provide useful predictive information for cholelithiasis or associated conditions. Thus, it does not present a novel or interesting finding for clinical relevance.","No. Basophil percentage is typically not associated with gallbladder diseases or cholangitis. It is more relevant in the context of allergic reactions or parasitic infections, and given the high p-value and low correlation, it suggests that this feature does not provide meaningful information regarding the risk or presence of cholelithiasis or related conditions."
Enhanced Genetic risk for height (HEIGHT),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"similar to row 65 - feature used twice, by mistake","No. The feature does not appear to have any relevant association with the target diseases of cholelithiasis, gallstones, gallbladder disease, or cholangitis. A p-value of 0.931 indicates a lack of statistical significance, and the weak correlation suggests that height genetics are unlikely to influence the risk or development of these conditions. Therefore, it is not interesting or novel in this context.","No. There is no established mechanism linking genetic risk for height to the development of cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. Height is largely influenced by genetic factors and does not have a direct correlation with the physiological or metabolic processes involved in the formation of gallstones or gallbladder disease. Additionally, the statistical significance (high p-value) suggests that this feature does not meaningfully predict or influence the target diseases in question."
Average Diameter for VLDL Particles,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,"Yes. Larger VLDL particles may influence lipid metabolism, potentially impacting bile composition and gallstone formation. Changes in bile composition can affect the solubility of cholesterol, leading to an increased risk of cholelithiasis. Therefore, this feature has a plausible biological mechanism connecting it to gallbladder diseases.","Yes. The size of VLDL particles can influence lipid metabolism and gallstone formation. Larger VLDL particles are associated with increased triglyceride levels, which may lead to bile supersaturation and contribute to gallstone disease. Elevated triglycerides can also be a risk factor for metabolic syndrome, which is linked to gallbladder disease. Thus, there is a plausible mechanism by which variations in VLDL particle size could affect the risk of cholelithiasis and related conditions."
Job code at visit industrial,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,This is a not an ordinal data (i assume)  - probably irrlavent but we should check,"No. This feature is likely not directly relevant to cholelithiasis or related conditions. While job code may indicate exposure to certain environmental factors or stressors, the correlation and predictive importance are low, suggesting it does not significantly contribute to understanding the risk for gallbladder disease. Further research would be needed to establish any meaningful association.","No. Job code alone does not directly correlate with the development of gallbladder diseases. While certain occupations may be associated with lifestyle factors (like diet or stress) that could influence gallbladder health, the feature lacks specificity and does not provide a clear mechanism to link job type directly to cholelithiasis or related diseases. More contextual information would be needed to establish any meaningful connection."
Microalbumin in urine,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"related to diabetes, HTN, metabolic syndrome,  relativly high P-value","No. The p-value is above the conventional threshold for significance (0.05), indicating that the association is not statistically significant. Additionally, the correlation and SHAP importance values are very low, suggesting that this feature does not meaningfully contribute to predicting gallbladder-related diseases. There is no clear or plausible mechanism linking microalbumin in urine to cholelithiasis or related conditions, making this feature unlikely to be interesting or novel in this context.","No. The lack of a significant association (p-value 0.123) and low correlation (0.009) suggest that microalbumin in urine is unlikely to be directly relevant to cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. Additionally, microalbuminuria is primarily associated with kidney function and diabetic nephropathy rather than conditions related to gallstones or cholangitis, making it an unlikely predictor or risk factor in this context. The mechanism connecting urinary microalbumin levels to gallbladder disease is not clear and lacks supporting evidence."
Genetic risk for primary open angle glaucoma,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Mid  P value + low correlation,"No. The p-value (0.095) indicates that there is no strong evidence to suggest a significant association between genetic risk for primary open angle glaucoma and the target diseases (cholelithiasis, gallstones, gallbladder disease, or cholangitis). Additionally, the correlation is very low (-0.002), which suggests that there is likely no meaningful relationship between these two features. Therefore, this feature is not interesting or novel in the context of the target diseases.","No. There is no established or plausible mechanism linking the genetic risk for primary open-angle glaucoma to the development of cholelithiasis or related gallbladder diseases. These conditions affect different organ systems and are governed by distinct pathophysiological processes. While genetics can play a role in various health conditions, the correlation and relevance between these two specific features appear weak and likely coincidental."
Concentration of IDL Particles,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,"No. - While elevated levels of intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) can be associated with lipid metabolism disorders and cardiovascular diseases, there is limited direct evidence linking IDL particles specifically to the pathogenesis of gallstones or gallbladder disease. The correlation and SHAP importance values suggest that this feature may not have a significant impact on the target conditions in a clinical context. Additionally, the p-value indicates that the association is not strong enough to be considered a significant predictor or risk factor.","Yes. Intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) particles are involved in lipid metabolism and can contribute to the formation of gallstones through their impact on cholesterol levels and bile composition. Elevated IDL levels may indicate dyslipidemia, which is a risk factor for gallbladder disease. The relationship between lipid metabolism and gallstone formation is well-established, making this feature relevant and plausible in the context of the target diseases mentioned."
Genetic risk for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Mid P value + low correlation,"No. The p-value of 0.28 indicates that the association is not statistically significant, meaning there is insufficient evidence to support that genetic risk for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has any meaningful impact on the risk of cholelithiasis or related diseases. Additionally, there is no clear or plausible biological mechanism connecting SLE to gallbladder disease or cholelithiasis, making this feature unlikely to be interesting or novel in this context.","No. There is no established link or plausible mechanism connecting genetic risk for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with gallbladder diseases such as cholelithiasis, gallstones, or cholecystitis. SLE is primarily an autoimmune condition affecting various organ systems, while gallbladder diseases are more closely related to metabolic factors, diet, and bile composition. The p-value indicates a lack of statistical significance, further suggesting that this feature is unlikely to be a relevant predictive factor for the target diseases."
Genetic risk for primary open angle glaucoma (POAG),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,High P value + low correlation,"No. The relationship between genetic risk for primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and gallbladder diseases is not well-established. There is no clear or plausible mechanism connecting genetic factors for glaucoma with the development of cholelithiasis or other gallbladder diseases. The statistical significance (p-value of 0.095) also suggests that this feature is not a strong predictor, and the correlation is very weak. Therefore, it is unlikely to be a relevant or novel feature in this context.","No. There is no established biological or clinical mechanism linking genetic risk factors for primary open-angle glaucoma to gallbladder diseases such as cholelithiasis or cholangitis. These conditions involve different pathophysiological processes, and the correlation reported here is weak (correlation: -0.002) and not statistically significant (p-value: 0.095). Thus, this feature does not make sense as a predictor for the target diseases."
Concentration of HDL Particles,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,"No. HDL cholesterol is not directly associated with the risk of gallstone disease; rather, it is more commonly linked to cardiovascular health. There is insufficient evidence to support HDL particles as a relevant predictive feature for gallbladder-related diseases, making this feature less interesting and novel in this context.","Yes. HDL cholesterol is known to play a role in lipid metabolism and may influence gallstone formation. Higher concentrations of HDL particles can be associated with healthier lipid profiles, which may reduce the risk of cholesterol gallstones. Given that gallstones are primarily composed of cholesterol, the mechanism through which HDL affects gallstone disease is plausible."
Alcohol-related disorders,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,oppsite to https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27926662/,"No. The p-value is close to the significance threshold (0.05), and the correlation is very weak. While alcohol consumption has been studied in relation to gallstone diseases, the evidence is not strong enough to suggest that alcohol-related disorders are a significant predictor or risk factor for cholelithiasis or related conditions. Additionally, the SHAP importance value is low, indicating that this feature does not have a strong influence on the model's predictions. Therefore, it may not be a novel or particularly interesting feature in this context.","No. The association is weak and the p-value is close to the threshold for significance. Alcohol-related disorders are generally thought to be inversely related to gallstone disease, as moderate alcohol intake has been associated with a reduced risk of gallstone formation. Additionally, the correlation and SHAP importance values suggest that this feature is likely not a strong predictor or a direct risk factor for the target diseases mentioned. There isn't a clear or strong biological mechanism linking alcohol-related disorders to cholelithiasis or gallbladder disease, making this feature less relevant in this context."
Alcohol intake frequency. Never,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,oppsite to https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27926662/,"No. Alcohol consumption has been shown to have a protective effect against gallstone disease, as evidenced by studies indicating that moderate alcohol intake is associated with a lower risk of developing gallstones. Thus, the feature ""Alcohol intake frequency. Never"" does not align with existing evidence and does not provide novel or interesting insights into the risk factors for cholelithiasis or related diseases.","Yes. Alcohol has been associated with lower risk of gallstone disease, as moderate alcohol consumption may influence lipid metabolism and cholesterol saturation in bile, thereby potentially reducing gallstone formation. However, the correlation here suggests a complex relationship, and the negative correlation might indicate that those who do not consume alcohol may have other underlying risk factors for gallstone disease."
Genetic risk for psoriasis (PSO),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,High P value + low correlation,"No. The p-value indicates that the association is not statistically significant, and the correlation is very weak. Additionally, there is no established mechanism linking genetic risk for psoriasis directly to gallbladder diseases. Therefore, this feature does not appear to be relevant or novel in the context of predicting the target diseases.","No. There is currently no established mechanism connecting genetic risk factors for psoriasis with gallbladder diseases such as cholelithiasis or cholangitis. The correlation is weak and the p-value indicates a lack of statistical significance, which suggests that this feature is unlikely to be relevant in predicting the target diseases. In the absence of a plausible biological pathway or strong epidemiological evidence, it does not seem to make sense as a predictive factor for these conditions."
Qualifications College or University degree|A levels/AS levels or equivalent|O levels/GCSEs or equivalent,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,younger people? is this an ordinal value?,"No. This feature likely reflects socioeconomic status or education level rather than a direct biological mechanism influencing the risk of cholelithiasis or related diseases. While there may be indirect correlations (e.g., educated individuals may have healthier lifestyles), it does not provide specific insights into the pathophysiology of gallbladder diseases. The correlation is weak, and the SHAP importance is low, indicating it is not a strong predictor.","No. Education level does not directly influence the pathophysiology of cholelithiasis or gallbladder disease. While it may correlate with lifestyle factors such as diet or healthcare access, the correlation is weak and likely indirect. The p-value indicates that the association is not statistically significant enough to suggest a meaningful predictive relationship."
Circulatory disease NEC,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,related to metabolic synmdrome,"No. The p-value of 0.523 indicates a lack of statistical significance, and the correlation and SHAP importance values are very low, suggesting that ""Circulatory disease NEC"" is unlikely to be a relevant predictor or risk factor for cholelithiasis or related diseases. This feature does not provide strong evidence of an association and may not have a plausible biological mechanism connecting it to the target diseases. Therefore, it lacks novelty and clinical relevance in this context.","No. The p-value of 0.523 suggests that there is no statistically significant association between circulatory disease and the target diseases of interest. Additionally, the weak correlation and low SHAP importance indicate that this feature is unlikely to provide meaningful predictive value or have a plausible mechanism affecting cholelithiasis or related conditions. Circulatory diseases typically involve the heart and blood vessels, and while they may share common risk factors with gallbladder diseases (such as obesity or metabolic syndrome), a direct causal relationship is not supported by the data provided."
3-Hydroxybutyrate,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,High P value + low correlation,"No. The p-value is high (0.306), indicating that this feature does not have a statistically significant association with the target disease. The correlation is also very low (-0.002), suggesting that there is virtually no linear relationship between 3-Hydroxybutyrate levels and the risk of developing cholelithiasis or related conditions. Additionally, the SHAP importance is minimal (0.001), indicating that this feature does not contribute meaningfully to the predictive model. Therefore, it is not a novel or interesting feature in this context.","No. The p-value of 0.306 indicates that there is not a statistically significant association between 3-Hydroxybutyrate levels and the target diseases. Additionally, the correlation coefficient of -0.002 suggests that there is virtually no relationship between this feature and the diseases in question. Without a significant correlation or a plausible biological mechanism linking 3-Hydroxybutyrate to cholelithiasis, gallstones, gallbladder disease, or cholangitis, it is unlikely that this feature would be considered relevant or interesting in this context."
Hallux valgus (Bunion),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,High P value + low correlation,"No. Hallux valgus (bunion) is primarily a musculoskeletal condition affecting the foot and does not have a known biological or clinical connection to gallbladder diseases such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. The p-value of 0.095 suggests that it is not statistically significant, and the correlation of 0.0 indicates no relationship. Therefore, it is unlikely to be a relevant predictive feature or risk factor for the target diseases.","No. There is no plausible mechanism or direct relationship between hallux valgus (bunion) and cholelithiasis or gallbladder disease. Hallux valgus is a foot condition related primarily to structural deformities and does not have a known impact on biliary or gastrointestinal health. The p-value suggests a lack of statistical significance, and the correlation and SHAP importance values are low, indicating that this feature is unlikely to be a meaningful predictor or risk factor for the target diseases in question."
Cholesterol in Chylomicrons and Extremely Large VLDL,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE," - Our meta-analysis found insufficient evidence for the effect of APOE E4 on GSD risk. 

","No. The relationship between cholesterol levels in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and the development of gallstones is well established, and the feature does not provide new insights into the risk factors for gallbladder diseases. Elevated cholesterol levels can lead to the formation of gallstones, but this is not a novel finding, as it is a long-recognized and commonly studied aspect in the context of cholelithiasis and gallbladder disease. Therefore, while it is relevant, it is not particularly novel or interesting in the context of predicting the target diseases.","Yes. Cholesterol metabolism is directly related to the formation of gallstones, particularly cholesterol stones. Elevated levels of cholesterol in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) could contribute to supersaturation of bile, leading to the precipitation of cholesterol and subsequent gallstone formation. Understanding the role of these specific lipoproteins may provide insights into lipid-related pathways that influence the development of gallbladder diseases, including cholelithiasis and cholecystitis."
Job code at visit clerks,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,This is a not an ordinal data (i assume)  - probably irrlavent but we should check,"No. Job code is not likely to be directly related to the biological or lifestyle factors that influence the risk of cholelithiasis or gallbladder disease. The p-value indicates that the correlation is not statistically significant, and the SHAP importance is low, suggesting that this feature does not provide meaningful predictive value for the target disease.","No. The feature 'Job code at visit clerks' does not appear to have a direct biological or clinical relevance to the development of cholelithiasis or related diseases. Job classification is unlikely to influence the risk of gallbladder disease, as it does not correlate with known risk factors such as diet, lifestyle, or genetic predisposition. Therefore, there is no plausible mechanism for this feature to affect the target disease, making it not interesting or novel in this context."
"Other diseases of respiratory system, NEC",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,High P value + low correlation,"No. The p-value is relatively high (0.303), indicating that this feature is not statistically significant. Additionally, the correlation is very low (-0.002), suggesting that there is no meaningful relationship between respiratory diseases and the risk of developing cholelithiasis or related conditions. Therefore, there is no plausible mechanism to suggest that other diseases of the respiratory system would impact gallbladder disease risk, making this feature unlikely to be interesting or novel in this context.","No. The p-value and correlation suggest that this feature does not have a significant or meaningful relationship with the target diseases. There is no established mechanism linking respiratory diseases to cholelithiasis or gallbladder diseases, making this feature unlikely to be relevant in predicting or influencing the target disease."
