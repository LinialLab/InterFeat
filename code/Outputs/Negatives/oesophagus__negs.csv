The use of chemotherapy in esophageal cancer is primarily for palliative purposes, aiming to improve quality of life and prolong survival in patients with advanced or metastatic disease. The combination of chemotherapy agents such as fluoropyrimidines, platinum-based drugs, and taxanes has shown some activity against esophageal cancer, with response rates ranging from 10% to 40%. However, the effectiveness of chemotherapy in esophageal cancer is still being investigated, and more research is needed to fully understand its role in treatment. The use of chemotherapy in esophageal cancer is not a known risk or protective factor, but rather a treatment approach.

Alcohol consumption is a known risk factor for esophageal cancer, and the frequency of alcohol intake is an important aspect of this relationship. The more frequently an individual consumes alcohol, the higher their risk of developing esophageal cancer. This relationship is supported by numerous studies that have investigated the association between alcohol intake and the risk of esophageal cancer. Therefore, the feature 'Alcohol intake frequency.

A doctor's diagnosis is a crucial aspect of identifying and managing esophageal cancer. The presence of this feature indicates that the patient has not been diagnosed with cancer by a doctor, which is a risk factor for esophageal cancer. This is because early detection and diagnosis of esophageal cancer are critical for effective treatment and management. A doctor's diagnosis is a key factor in identifying patients with esophageal cancer, and the absence of such a diagnosis suggests that the patient may not have been properly evaluated for the disease.

Ulcers in the esophagus can be a precursor to cancer, particularly in the context of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The presence of ulcers can lead to chronic inflammation, which can progress to dysplasia and eventually cancer. This is a well-known risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma, which is the most common type of esophageal cancer. Therefore, the association between 'Ulcer of esophagus' and 'oesophagus cancer' is not new or surprising, but rather a well-established and critical aspect of esophageal cancer pathogenesis.",True
