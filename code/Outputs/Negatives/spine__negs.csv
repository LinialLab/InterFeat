The feature is related to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, while the target disease is related to musculoskeletal and spinal disorders. There is no direct link between blood clots, DVT, bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, rhinitis, eczema, and allergy and disc displacement, degeneration, disorder, back pain, spine disease, or Spondylosis. However, smoking, which is a risk factor for both cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, is also a risk factor for disc degeneration.

The relationship between education level and spinal health is well established in medical literature. Higher education levels have been associated with a lower risk of developing spinal problems, including disc degeneration and back pain. This is likely due to a combination of factors, including better access to healthcare, healthier lifestyle choices, and lower levels of physical stress. Therefore, the association between this feature and the target disease is well known and explained by existing knowledge.",True

However, the relationship between education level and disc degeneration is not as straightforward as other risk factors such as smoking, obesity, or physical inactivity. Therefore, the association between the feature and the target disease is not well known or explained by existing knowledge.",False
Back pain,missing_Back pain,1,95295,1.0,inf,92926,0.017,0.0,-0.11,0.012,C0004604,(disc displacement) OR (disc degeneration) OR (disc disorder) OR (back AND pain) OR (spine disease) OR (Spondylosis),A,"The relationship between 'Back pain' and the target diseases is well established in the medical literature. Back pain is a common symptom that can be caused by various conditions, including disc displacement, disc degeneration, disc disorder, back pain, spine disease, and Spondylosis. The presence of back pain is often used as a symptom to guide further diagnostic testing, such as imaging studies, to identify the underlying cause. However, the absence of back pain does not rule out the presence of these conditions, as many cases of disc displacement, disc degeneration, and Spondylosis can be asymptomatic. Therefore, the association between 'Back pain' and the target diseases is not a risk or protective factor, but rather a symptom that can be used to guide further evaluation and diagnosis.",True

The degenerative changes in the spine, including osteoarthritis, can lead to the narrowing of the spinal canal, which can cause compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots, resulting in pain and other symptoms.

The degeneration of the intervertebral discs and facet joints can lead to the formation of osteophytes, joint space narrowing, and loss of disc height, which can cause pain and discomfort. This process is a well-known risk factor for the development of disc displacement, disc degeneration, disc disorder, back pain, spine disease, and Spondylosis.

Cervical spondylosis is a natural age-related disease process that is associated with degenerative changes within the intervertebral disc. It most commonly presents as neck pain, which remains as one of the leading causes of disability and rising healthcare costs. The association between the feature 'cervical' and 'disc displacement OR disc degeneration OR disc disorder OR back AND pain OR spine disease OR Spondylosis' is well known and explained by existing knowledge.

Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that affects not only the joints but also the spine, leading to conditions such as disc degeneration, disc displacement, and back pain. The relationship between osteoarthritis and spinal conditions is well-documented, and it is considered a risk factor for these conditions. Therefore, the association is not new or surprising, but rather a well-established and known relationship.",True
