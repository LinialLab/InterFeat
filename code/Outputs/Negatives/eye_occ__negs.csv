Glaucoma is a risk factor for retinal vein occlusion and central retinal artery occlusion. The relationship between glaucoma and these conditions is established in the provided documents. Glaucoma can lead to increased intraocular pressure, which can cause damage to the optic nerve and increase the risk of retinal vein occlusion and central retinal artery occlusion. Additionally, the documents mention that glaucoma is a risk factor for neovascular glaucoma, which is a complication of retinal vein occlusion. Therefore, the association between the feature 'glaucoma' and 'Retinal Vein Occlusion OR Central retinal artery occlusion' is well known and established.",True
