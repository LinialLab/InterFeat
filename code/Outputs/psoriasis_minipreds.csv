(AAM) age at menopause genetic risk,(psoriasis) OR (Seborrheic dermatitis),"The association between age at menopause and risk of psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis is not well-documented in current knowledge. The relationship between menopause and skin conditions is complex and influenced by various factors, including hormonal changes, age, and lifestyle. While some studies suggest that menopause may be associated with an increased risk of certain skin conditions, the relationship between age at menopause and psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis is not well-established. Therefore, this association is not well-documented and may provide new insights or contradict established understanding.","The relationship between age at menopause and psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis is not well established. However, there is evidence that hormonal changes during menopause may affect the skin and increase the risk of certain skin conditions. For example, the decline in estrogen levels during menopause can lead to changes in the skin's natural barrier function, making it more susceptible to inflammation and irritation. Additionally, the increase in androgen hormones during menopause can lead to an increase in sebum production, which can contribute to the development of seborrheic dermatitis. Therefore, it is plausible that age at menopause could be associated with an increased risk of psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis, particularly if the menopause occurs at an earlier age. However, this relationship is likely to be complex and influenced by multiple factors, including genetic predisposition, lifestyle, and other environmental factors. ","The feature (AAM) age at menopause genetic risk is not directly related to psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis. Psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis are skin conditions that are not directly linked to menopause or age at menopause. Therefore, this feature does not have practical relevance or utility for predicting psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis.",1,1,0
Long standing illness disability or infirmity,(psoriasis) OR (Seborrheic dermatitis),"The association between long-standing illness, disability or infirmity and psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis is not well-documented in current knowledge. The feature provides new insights as it suggests that individuals with long-standing illness, disability or infirmity may have a higher risk of developing psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis. This association is not well-established in the provided documents, and the feature contradicts the established understanding that psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis are primarily skin conditions. Therefore, the association is novel and provides new insights.","Long-standing illness, disability or infirmity can lead to chronic inflammation and immune system dysregulation, which can contribute to the development of psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. Additionally, stress and anxiety associated with long-standing illness can exacerbate skin conditions. Furthermore, certain medications used to treat long-standing illness can also trigger or worsen psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. Therefore, there is a plausible explanation for the relationship between long-standing illness, disability or infirmity and psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis.","Long-standing illness, disability or infirmity is a feature that can be correlated with psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis. This feature can be used to predict the presence of these conditions.

Tobacco use disorder,(psoriasis) OR (Seborrheic dermatitis),"Tobacco use disorder is associated with various health issues, including cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and cancer. Psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis are skin conditions that have been linked to various underlying health issues, including cardiovascular disease and inflammatory processes. The connection between tobacco use disorder and psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis is not well-documented in current knowledge, and it is not established that tobacco use disorder is a risk factor for these skin conditions. However, it is known that smoking can exacerbate psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. Therefore, the association between tobacco use disorder and psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis is not well-documented and may provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of these skin conditions.","Tobacco use disorder is associated with psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis through the mechanism of inflammation. Tobacco smoke contains over 7,000 chemicals, many of which are harmful and can cause inflammation in the body. Inflammation is a known risk factor for both psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. Additionally, tobacco smoke can also damage the skin and cause skin conditions such as psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. Furthermore, tobacco use disorder can also lead to other health problems such as cardiovascular disease, which can also increase the risk of developing psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. Therefore, there is a plausible explanation for the relationship between tobacco use disorder and psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis.","Tobacco use disorder is a known risk factor for several health conditions, including psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. Studies have shown that smoking can trigger or exacerbate these conditions. Therefore, assessing tobacco use disorder can be useful in identifying individuals at risk for these conditions and guiding interventions to prevent or manage them. The 5 A's approach, which includes assessing tobacco use disorder, can be a useful tool in this regard. Additionally, the DSM-5 criteria for tobacco use disorder can be used to diagnose and monitor the condition. Overall, tobacco use disorder has potential utility or practical relevance in predicting psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis.",1,1,1
Acetone,(psoriasis) OR (Seborrheic dermatitis),"The association between acetone and psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis is not well-documented in current knowledge. Acetone is a metabolite of isopropanol, and its presence in the body can be a sign of isopropanol toxicity. Isopropanol toxicity can cause a range of symptoms, including skin lesions and rashes, which can be similar to those seen in psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. However, the specific association between acetone and these skin conditions is not well-established in the literature. Therefore, this association is novel and provides new insights into the potential underlying mechanisms of these conditions.","Acetone is a metabolite of isopropyl alcohol, which is toxic and can cause hypoglycemia. Seborrheic dermatitis is a condition that can be caused by Pityrosporus ovale, a yeast found in sebum and hair follicles. Psoriasis is a condition that can be triggered by various factors, including genetics, environmental factors, and immune system dysfunction. There is no direct link between acetone and psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis. However, acetone can be a byproduct of isopropyl alcohol metabolism, which can be toxic and cause hypoglycemia, a condition that can be associated with various diseases, including psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. Therefore, there is a plausible explanation for the relationship between acetone and psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis, but it is indirect and based on the toxic effects of isopropyl alcohol metabolism.","Acetone is a ketone body that can be produced in the body during states of fasting or starvation. It is also a metabolite of isopropanol, a toxic alcohol that can be ingested. In the context of skin conditions, acetone is not a direct cause of psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis, but it can be a marker for underlying metabolic or toxicological conditions that may contribute to the development of these conditions. For example, patients with diabetes or those who have ingested isopropanol may have elevated levels of acetone in their breath or urine. In the case of seborrheic dermatitis, the presence of acetone may indicate a metabolic or toxicological component to the condition. However, it is essential to note that acetone is not a specific marker for psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis, and its presence does not confirm the diagnosis of either condition. Therefore, while acetone may have some utility as a marker for underlying conditions that may contribute to the development of psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis, it lacks utility as a standalone diagnostic tool for these conditions.",1,1,0
