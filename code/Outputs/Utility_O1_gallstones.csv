"Complications of cardiac/vascular device, implant, and graft",Unrelated complications that do not meaningfully inform gallbladder disease risk or management.,FALSE,1
LDL direct Blood biochemistry,"LDL is central to cholesterol metabolism, but weak/negative correlation here diminishes its direct clinical utility in gallbladder disease.",FALSE,2
A09.9 - Gastroenteritis and colitis of unspecified origin,"GI inflammation might overlap with biliary disease symptoms, but correlation is weak and not routinely actionable.",FALSE,2
(LDL_SF) low density lipoprotein cholesterol genetic risk,"Genetic predisposition to elevated LDL could affect cholesterol gallstones, but evidence is too weak for robust clinical use.",FALSE,2
Vitamin D,"Possible minor role in metabolism/inflammation, but negative correlation is weak and not strongly actionable in gallbladder care.",FALSE,2
Sleep - Overall average,General health factor with unclear and weak link to gallbladder disease; low direct utility for clinical decisions.,FALSE,2
(AD) alzheimer's disease genetic risk,No recognized mechanistic overlap with gallbladder disease; offers no practical predictive or management utility.,FALSE,1
(SCZ) schizophrenia genetic risk,Psychiatric genetic risk does not meaningfully inform gallbladder disease risk or management.,FALSE,1
Started insulin within one year diagnosis of diabetes_No,Diabetes severity (requiring insulin early) can raise gallbladder risk; moderate usefulness for risk stratification.,TRUE,3
Bipolar and major depression status_None,"Mood disorder status has limited direct bearing on gallbladder disease, offering slight or indirect utility at best.",FALSE,2
Z90.7 - Acquired absence of genital organ(s),No clear pathophysiologic link to gallbladder disease; not useful in gallbladder risk profiling.,FALSE,1
Other specified gastritis,Non-specific GI inflammation connection is weak; only marginally useful for gallbladder risk considerations.,FALSE,2
Townsend deprivation index at recruitment,"Socioeconomic deprivation can correlate with obesity and healthcare access, making it moderately relevant to gallbladder disease.",TRUE,3
Treatment/medication code | Array 0__omeprazole,"PPI usage is not strongly associated with gallbladder disease; correlation is weak, so limited utility.",FALSE,2
(AAM) age at menopause genetic risk,"Hormonal influences do matter, but negative correlation is weak; slight potential utility only.",FALSE,2
M79.66 - Pain in limb (Lower leg),No direct or recognized link to gallbladder pathology; no practical predictive value.,FALSE,1
Acetone,"Reflects certain metabolic states (ketosis), but not strongly tied to gallbladder disease for clinical application.",FALSE,2
Ever addicted to a behaviour or miscellanous_Yes,Behavioral addiction lacks clear association with gallbladder disease risk; no actionable utility.,FALSE,1
Time spend outdoors in summer_2,"Might link to healthier habits, but correlation is too weak to yield concrete clinical utility.",FALSE,2
Acetate,"A short-chain fatty acid with possible metabolic influences, but no strong evidence for gallbladder disease management.",FALSE,2
