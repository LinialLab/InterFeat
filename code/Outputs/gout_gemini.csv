Feature_Name,correlation,explanation,Overall Interesting,annot-Interesting?,
Haemoglobin concentration,negative,"Anemia (low Hb) can be seen in chronic kidney disease (CKD), a major risk factor for gout due to impaired urate excretion. [7, 17, 25] Chronic inflammation (common in gout) can also lead to anemia of chronic disease. So, a negative correlation is plausible and reflects known disease associations. Not highly novel.",0,3,1
Meat substitutes - vegetarian,positive,"Vegetarian diets are often associated with *lower* gout risk due to lower purine intake (though some plant sources are high in purines). [2, 23, 35] A positive correlation (meat substitutes increasing gout risk) is novel and counterintuitive if these substitutes are generally low-purine. It might depend on the specific composition of the substitutes (e.g., high yeast content, certain protein isolates). This is interesting.",1,4,1
Health satisfaction_Moderately unhappy,positive,"Gout is a painful, chronic condition that can negatively impact quality of life and mood. [4] A positive correlation between being moderately unhappy and having gout is plausible as a consequence of the disease or due to shared factors like chronic stress influencing inflammation. Less likely to be a primary causal factor for gout onset but could indicate disease burden.",0,3,1
Average Diameter for VLDL Particles,positive,"Larger VLDL particles are often seen in dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome, which are strongly associated with hyperuricemia and gout. [6, 20, 26, 30, 32] Increased VLDL indicates impaired lipid metabolism, often linked to insulin resistance, which can reduce renal urate excretion. Plausible and consistent with known metabolic links. Not highly novel.",0,3,1
(ISS) ischaemic stroke genetic risk,positive,"Ischemic stroke and gout share common risk factors like hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and chronic inflammation (components of metabolic syndrome). [10, 24] A shared genetic predisposition towards these factors or common inflammatory/vascular pathways makes a positive correlation plausible. Moderately novel if it highlights specific genetic links beyond general shared risk.",1,3,1
(POAG) primary open angle glaucoma genetic risk,negative,"Some studies suggest an inverse relationship between uric acid levels and glaucoma risk, with higher urate potentially being neuroprotective for retinal ganglion cells. [1, 33] Gout is characterized by high uric acid. Thus, a genetic risk for POAG being negatively correlated with gout (i.e., gout being protective against POAG or vice-versa) is plausible and interesting. It aligns with the uric acid as antioxidant/neuroprotectant hypothesis.",1,2,0
Falls in the last year_More than one fall,positive,"Gout attacks, particularly in the lower extremities (e.g., podagra), can cause severe pain, joint damage, and impaired mobility, increasing fall risk. [12] Tophi can also cause deformities. Plausible consequence of established gout. Not novel as a cause of gout.",0,2,0
Townsend deprivation index at recruitment,positive,"Higher deprivation is associated with poorer diet, higher rates of obesity, alcohol consumption, and reduced access to healthcare or health education, all of which are risk factors for gout. [15, 18, 31] Well-established socioeconomic link. Not novel.",0,1,0
Hemorrhage of gastrointestinal tract,negative,"Common gout medications like NSAIDs and colchicine can cause GI bleeding. [5, 11] Allopurinol is generally safer for GI. If this means active GI hemorrhage *reduces* gout diagnosis likelihood (negative correlation), it could be due to diagnostic overshadowing, contraindication to initiating urate-lowering therapy, or patients avoiding NSAIDs that might precipitate gout attacks if they have a history of GI bleed (though this is complex). If it means absence of GI hemorrhage is linked to gout, that's also complex. The negative correlation makes it somewhat counterintuitive from a medication side-effect perspective unless it's about a protective effect of something associated with GI bleeds, or an avoidance behavior. Mildly interesting.",0,1,0
Concentration of IDL Particles,negative,"Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL) are part of lipid metabolism, a precursor to LDL. Dyslipidemia, typically with high triglycerides and LDL, and low HDL, is linked to gout. [26, 32] If lower IDL is linked to higher gout risk, it's somewhat counterintuitive as IDL is generally considered atherogenic. This could indicate specific metabolic shifts worth investigating. Moderately interesting.",1,2,0
Irritability_Do not know,positive,"'Do not know' for irritability being positively correlated with gout is difficult to interpret biologically. It might be a proxy for survey response patterns, health literacy, or cognitive state rather than a direct link to irritability itself. Low plausibility for direct biological link and likely a data artifact. Not interesting.",0,,
Z90.7 - Acquired absence of genital organ(s),neutral,"Unlikely to have a direct, strong biological link to gout. Hormonal changes post-gonadectomy could theoretically influence urate levels (e.g., estrogen is uricosuric), but this is speculative for a strong predictive effect. The neutral correlation supports low relevance. Not interesting.",0,1,0
Concentration of HDL Particles,positive,"Higher HDL is generally considered protective against metabolic syndrome. [3, 8, 28] Metabolic syndrome is a strong risk factor for gout. [3, 8, 28] Thus, a positive correlation (higher HDL linked to *higher* gout risk) is highly novel and counterintuitive. This would challenge current understanding and is very interesting if robust.",1,2,0
Apolipoprotein B to Apolipoprotein A1 ratio,negative,"A high ApoB/ApoA1 ratio is a marker of dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome, strongly associated with gout. [6, 20, 26, 30, 32] A negative correlation (low ApoB/ApoA1 ratio, meaning more favorable lipid profile, linked to *higher* gout risk) is highly novel and counterintuitive. This is very interesting if robust.",1,2,0
(HBA1C_DF) glycated haemoglobin genetic risk,positive,"Genetic risk for higher HbA1c implies a predisposition to hyperglycemia/diabetes. [13] Diabetes and insulin resistance are well-known risk factors for hyperuricemia and gout (impaired renal urate excretion). [13, 22] A positive correlation is plausible and expected. Not highly novel.",0,2,0
Triglycerides Blood biochemistry,positive,"Elevated triglycerides are a core component of metabolic syndrome and are strongly associated with increased uric acid levels and gout. [6, 20, 26, 30, 32] Well-established risk factor. Not novel.",0,1,0
Arm fat percentage (left),positive,"Higher arm fat percentage indicates greater adiposity. Obesity is a very strong and well-established risk factor for gout due to increased urate production and reduced renal excretion, and its link to metabolic syndrome. [21, 29] Not novel.",0,2,0
3-Hydroxybutyrate,positive,"Elevated ketone bodies (like 3-hydroxybutyrate) can occur during fasting, ketogenic diets, or uncontrolled diabetes. These states can acutely increase uric acid levels (e.g., competition for renal excretion, increased purine breakdown during rapid weight loss), potentially triggering gout. [19, 27] Plausible link. Moderately novel as a specific biomarker.",1,3,1
Abnormality of gait,positive,"Gout frequently affects joints in the lower extremities (especially the big toe), causing pain, inflammation, and joint damage, which can lead to gait abnormalities. [12] Plausible consequence of gout. Not novel as a cause.",0,2,0
Home area population density - urban or rural_Scotland - Other Urban Area,negative,"Gout prevalence can vary by geography due to diet, lifestyle, SES, and healthcare access. [15, 18, 31] If 'Other Urban Area' being negatively correlated means lower gout risk compared to a reference (e.g., more deprived urban or rural areas with specific diets), it might reflect local protective factors. Mildly interesting for epidemiology.",0,2,0
Surgery/amputation of toe or leg_No,positive,"'No' surgery/amputation on toe/leg being positively correlated with gout is counterintuitive if one assumes surgery might relate to complications of severe gout (tophi, joint destruction). It could mean that people without such surgery are more likely to develop gout, or that gout itself doesn't commonly lead to amputation in this cohort, or that the reference group (those *with* surgery) has other conditions that make gout less likely. Confusing. Mildly interesting due to ambiguity.",0,1,0
Date of all cause dementia report,negative,"Gout and dementia risk both increase with age. [9, 16] Some research suggests urate may have neuroprotective effects, potentially linking high urate (gout) to lower dementia risk. [9, 16] A negative correlation (dementia report linked to *lower* gout risk or vice-versa) is plausible and interesting, supporting the neuroprotective hypothesis for urate.",1,,
Microalbumin in urine,positive,"Microalbuminuria is an early sign of kidney damage and endothelial dysfunction, often linked to hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. [7, 22] Impaired kidney function reduces urate excretion, a primary cause of gout. [7, 22] Highly plausible and consistent with kidney involvement in gout. Moderately established.",0,2,0
HDL cholesterol Blood biochemistry,negative,"Low HDL cholesterol is a component of metabolic syndrome and is typically associated with an *increased* risk of gout. [3, 8, 28] A negative correlation (lower HDL linked to higher gout risk) is expected. Not novel.",0,2,0
Concentration of Large VLDL Particles,positive,"Increased concentration of large VLDL particles is a feature of dyslipidemia seen in metabolic syndrome, which is strongly linked to hyperuricemia and gout. [6, 20, 26, 30, 32] Plausible and consistent with known metabolic associations. Not novel.",0,2,0
Vascular/heart problems diagnosed by doctor_High blood pressure,positive,"Hypertension is a very common comorbidity and risk factor for gout. [10, 17, 22, 24] It's part of metabolic syndrome and can impair renal urate excretion. [10, 17, 22, 24] Well-established link. Not novel.",0,2,0
Surgery on leg arteries (other than for varicose veins)_No,positive,"Similar to 'Surgery/amputation of toe or leg_No', this is counterintuitive. Peripheral artery disease (requiring surgery) shares risk factors with gout (smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia). 'No' surgery being positively linked to gout is confusing and warrants deeper investigation. Mildly interesting due to ambiguity.",0,,
Home area population density - urban or rural_Scotland - Large Urban Area,negative,Similar to 'Other Urban Area'. A negative correlation (lower gout risk in Large Urban Areas compared to a reference) could reflect specific local dietary/lifestyle patterns or healthcare access differences. Mildly interesting for epidemiology.,0,2,0
missing_Cancer of prostate,positive,"'Missing' data for prostate cancer being positively correlated with gout is hard to interpret biologically. It may indicate something about the group for whom this data is missing (e.g., older males, who are at higher risk for both, but the data is missing for a specific reason in that subgroup). More likely a data artifact or reflects characteristics of the 'missing' group. Not interesting.",0,,
(HDL) high density lipoprotein cholesterol genetic risk,negative,"Genetic predisposition to lower HDL cholesterol would be expected to increase gout risk (as low HDL is part of metabolic syndrome linked to gout). [3, 8, 28] A negative correlation (genetic risk for HDL is negatively associated with gout risk – implying higher genetic HDL is linked to *higher* gout risk, or lower genetic HDL is linked to *lower* gout risk) is counterintuitive if the typical HDL-gout relationship is considered. If it means genetic factors for *higher* HDL correlate with *higher* gout risk, it is very interesting. If it means genetic factors for *lower* HDL correlate with *lower* gout risk, also very interesting.",1,,
Fed-up feelings_Yes,positive,Chronic pain and disability from gout can lead to frustration and negative emotions. [4] 'Fed-up feelings' being positively correlated with gout is plausible as a psychological consequence of the disease. Not novel as a cause.,0,,
Home area population density - urban or rural_England/Wales - Urban - less sparse,positive,"Higher population density in urban areas can be associated with lifestyle factors (diet, alcohol) and prevalence of obesity that increase gout risk. [15, 18, 31] Positive correlation is plausible. Mildly interesting for epidemiology, but general link between urban living and some gout risk factors is known.",0,,
Fractured/broken bones in last 5 years_No,negative,"'No' fractures being negatively correlated with gout means having gout is associated with a *higher* likelihood of recent fractures. This is plausible as gout can lead to joint damage, tophi, and reduced mobility, potentially increasing fall risk and fracture incidence. [12] Chronic inflammation in gout might also affect bone metabolism. Moderately interesting.",1,,
"Never eat eggs, dairy, wheat",negative,"'Eating all of the above' (eggs, dairy, wheat, sugar) being negatively correlated with gout means this eating pattern is associated with *lower* gout risk. Dairy intake is known to be protective against gout. [2, 23, 35] High sugar intake (especially fructose) is a risk factor. [2, 23, 35] Egg and wheat effects are less clear-cut for gout specifically. The overall negative correlation suggests the protective effect of dairy (and perhaps other unlisted beneficial components of this broad pattern) might outweigh the risk from sugar in this group. Moderately interesting due to the mixed nature of the items.",1,,
Concentration of Very Large HDL Particles,negative,"Very large HDL particles are generally considered beneficial for cardiovascular health. [3, 8, 28] If their concentration is negatively correlated with gout (lower levels linked to higher gout risk), this aligns with the general understanding that dysfunctional or lower HDL is associated with metabolic syndrome and thus gout. Not highly novel.",0,,
SHBG,negative,"Low Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) is associated with insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and hyperandrogenism (in women), which can increase uric acid levels and gout risk. [14, 34] A negative correlation (lower SHBG linked to higher gout risk) is plausible and supported by literature. Moderately novel as a specific marker.",1,2,0
(SCZ) schizophrenia genetic risk,negative,"Some studies have reported lower uric acid levels in schizophrenia patients, and urate has been investigated for its potential role in CNS disorders. [36] A negative correlation (genetic risk for schizophrenia linked to *lower* gout risk or vice-versa) is plausible and interesting, potentially pointing to shared neurobiological or metabolic pathways involving urate.",1,2,0
missing_Z92.1 - Personal history of long-term (current) use of anticoagulants,negative,"'Missing' data for anticoagulant use being negatively correlated with gout. Anticoagulants are used for conditions like AF or VTE, which can share risk factors with gout (obesity, age). Perhaps the 'non-missing' group (those with known anticoagulant use) has a higher prevalence of gout due to these shared risks, making the 'missing' group appear to have a negative correlation. Hard to interpret directly. Not interesting.",0,1,0
Number of self-reported cancers,positive,"Cancer and its treatments (e.g., chemotherapy causing tumor lysis syndrome) can lead to hyperuricemia and secondary gout. [5] Also, shared risk factors like age, smoking, or chronic inflammation might link them. A positive correlation is plausible. Not highly novel.",0,2,0
Number of self-reported non-cancer illnesses,positive,"Higher comorbidity burden is expected with gout, as many chronic conditions (CKD, hypertension, metabolic syndrome) are risk factors or consequences. [10, 17, 22, 24, 25] Not novel.",0,2,0
(AST) asthma genetic risk,positive,"Asthma is an inflammatory condition. Some studies suggest links between atopic diseases and urate metabolism, or shared inflammatory pathways. [37] However, a strong, direct positive correlation between asthma genetic risk and gout is not well-established and would be novel and interesting.",1,2,0
Abdominal aortic aneurysm,negative,"AAA shares risk factors with gout, such as age, smoking, hypertension, and atherosclerosis (often linked to metabolic syndrome). [10, 24] A negative correlation (AAA linked to *lower* gout risk) would be counterintuitive, unless specific treatments for AAA or characteristics of the AAA population without gout are protective. Interesting if robust.",1,1,0
Z90.4 - Acquired absence of other parts of digestive tract,positive,"Surgical resection of parts of the digestive tract (e.g., bariatric surgery, bowel resection for IBD) can significantly alter nutrient absorption, gut microbiome, and overall metabolism, potentially impacting urate levels and gout risk. For example, some bariatric procedures can initially worsen then improve hyperuricemia. The positive correlation suggests these changes might increase gout risk in this cohort. Plausible and moderately interesting.",1,,
Non-cancer illness code  self-reported | Array 2__none,negative,"'None' for a second self-reported non-cancer illness being negatively correlated with gout implies that having *at least one* other illness (or more than one) is associated with gout. This is expected, as gout often coexists with other conditions. Not novel.",0,,
Mental health conditions ever diagnosed by a professional__of,negative,"This feature name is truncated ('__of'). Assuming it implies having *any* diagnosed mental health condition. Gout's chronic pain and disability can impact mental health. A negative correlation (mental health diagnosis linked to *lower* gout risk) would be counterintuitive if considering consequence, but could occur if certain mental health conditions or their treatments have urate-lowering effects, or if there are shared protective factors. Interesting due to ambiguity and potential novelty if a protective link exists.",1,3,1
Cholesterol in Small VLDL,negative,"Small, dense VLDL particles are often associated with atherogenic dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. [6, 20, 26, 30, 32] If cholesterol in these particles is negatively correlated with gout (lower levels linked to higher gout risk), it's counterintuitive to the general association of dyslipidemia with gout. This specific finding would be novel and interesting.",1,2,0
Other chronic ischemic heart disease,positive,"Chronic ischemic heart disease and gout share many underlying risk factors: metabolic syndrome, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation. [10, 24] A positive correlation is expected due to these shared pathologies. Not novel.",0,1,0
missing_Complications of transplants and reattached limbs,negative,"'Missing' data being negatively correlated is difficult to interpret. Patients with transplants are often on immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine) which can cause hyperuricemia and gout. Perhaps the 'non-missing' group (those with known complications) has a higher gout prevalence for these reasons, making the 'missing' group appear negatively correlated. Unclear biological meaning. Not interesting.",0,1,0
Epilepsy  recurrent seizures,negative,"Some older anti-epileptic drugs might affect folate metabolism, which is indirectly linked to purine metabolism. Urate levels have also been studied in epilepsy with mixed findings. A negative correlation (epilepsy linked to lower gout risk) is not strongly established but could be plausible via specific medication effects or underlying neurochemical differences. Moderately interesting.",1,2,0
Concentration of Small LDL Particles,negative,"Small, dense LDL particles are considered highly atherogenic and are a feature of metabolic syndrome, which is linked to gout. [26, 32] A negative correlation (lower concentration of small LDL linked to *higher* gout risk) is counterintuitive and would be novel, challenging the typical understanding of this particle type's role in metabolic diseases associated with gout. Very interesting.",1,,
(MS) multiple sclerosis genetic risk,positive,"Some research suggests an *inverse* relationship between MS and gout, with higher urate levels (seen in gout) potentially being protective against MS. [14, 36] A positive correlation (MS genetic risk linked to *higher* gout risk) would contradict this and be highly novel and interesting, suggesting alternative or more complex shared pathways.",1,3,1
Vitamin D,negative,"Low Vitamin D levels are common in chronic inflammatory conditions and have been associated with higher risk of some metabolic disorders. Some studies suggest an association between low Vitamin D and higher serum uric acid or gout, though findings are not always consistent. [38] A negative correlation (lower Vitamin D linked to higher gout risk) is plausible and aligns with some research suggesting Vitamin D's anti-inflammatory or metabolic roles. Moderately interesting.",1,,
Concentration of Chylomicrons and Extremely Large VLDL Particles,positive,"These particles are involved in triglyceride transport. Elevated levels are indicative of significant dyslipidemia, often seen postprandially or in certain metabolic disorders, which are associated with metabolic syndrome and gout. [6, 20, 26, 30, 32] Plausible. Not highly novel in the context of general dyslipidemia.",0,,
(MEL) melanoma genetic risk,positive,"Some studies suggest a link between gout and increased risk of certain cancers, possibly via chronic inflammation or shared metabolic pathways. [5] Urate itself has antioxidant and pro-oxidant properties depending on context. A direct positive genetic link between melanoma risk and gout is not well-established and would be novel and interesting.",1,2,0
Ever addicted to illicit or recreational drugs_Yes,positive,"Substance abuse can be associated with lifestyle factors that increase gout risk (poor diet, dehydration, alcohol which is often co-abused). Some drugs might directly affect urate metabolism or kidney function. A positive correlation is plausible. Moderately interesting.",1,3,1
Had major operations_No,negative,"'No' major operations being negatively correlated with gout means having had major operations is linked to *higher* gout risk. This could be due to post-operative stress increasing urate, immobility, use of diuretics, or underlying conditions necessitating surgery also being risk factors for gout. Plausible. Moderately interesting.",1,1,0
Ever addicted to illicit or recreational drugs_infrequent,neutral,"Infrequent drug use is less likely to have a strong, consistent impact on gout risk compared to regular addiction, unless specific substances known to acutely raise urate were used. Neutral correlation supports low impact. Not interesting.",0,1,0
Cellulitis and abscess of arm/hand,positive,"Gout tophi can sometimes become inflamed or infected, mimicking cellulitis. Also, skin breaks over tophi can be entry points for infection. [12] It's also possible that systemic inflammation from an infection could trigger a gout flare in a predisposed individual. Plausible association, potentially as a complication or trigger. Moderately interesting.",1,1,0
Abnormal findings on examination of urine,neutral,"Abnormal urine findings (e.g., proteinuria, hematuria) can indicate kidney dysfunction. Impaired kidney function is a major cause of gout. However, 'abnormal findings' is very broad. A neutral correlation suggests this general category isn't strongly predictive in this dataset, or specific abnormalities are needed. Not interesting if neutral despite plausible links for specific abnormalities.",0,1,0
Cholesterol in IDL,negative,"Similar to 'Concentration of IDL Particles'. If lower cholesterol in IDL is linked to higher gout risk, it's somewhat counterintuitive as IDL cholesterol contributes to the atherogenic lipid profile usually associated with gout. This specific finding would be novel and interesting. (Same reasoning as Concentration of IDL Particles, negative correlation).",1,3,1
